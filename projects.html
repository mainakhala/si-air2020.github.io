<h2>How we do it</h2>
  <p>The process begins when we are informed by a caseworker from one of the local shelters that an individual or family is moving out of the shelter and into a local house or apartment and needs our services. Next, we meet with the clients to assess their needs and to evaluate the space they will be moving into. Then, we begin pulling the appropriate furniture and household items from our inventory and make a plan for move-in day. Finally, a team of volunteers complete the home makeover, placing the furniture and other items in just the right spot for the final reveal!

    <h4>Volunteers</h4>
    <p>“You know my favorite part?  It’s finding those one or two special things that are truly personal. I think more than all the fabulous furniture, it’s the personal touch that says, ‘I see you.”
